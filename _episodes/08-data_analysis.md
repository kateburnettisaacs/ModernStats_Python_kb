## Analyzing data

NumPy has several useful functions that take an array as input to perform operations on its values.
If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on
all days, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data))
```

```output
6.14875
```

`mean` is a [function](../learners/reference.md#function) that takes
an array as an [argument](../learners/reference.md#argument).

## Not All Functions Have Input

Generally, a function uses inputs to produce outputs.
However, some functions produce outputs without
needing any input. For example, checking the current time
doesn't require any input.

```python
import time
print(time.ctime())
```

```output
Sat Mar 26 13:07:33 2016
```

For functions that don't take in any arguments,
we still need parentheses (`()`)
to tell Python to go and do something for us.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's use three other NumPy functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

```python
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.amax(data), numpy.amin(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum inflammation:', maxval)
print('minimum inflammation:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
```

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.amax(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.amin(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

```output
maximum inflammation: 20.0
minimum inflammation: 0.0
standard deviation: 4.61383319712
```

## Mystery Functions in IPython

How did we know what functions NumPy has and how to use them?
If you are working in IPython or in a Jupyter Notebook, there is an easy way to find out.
If you type the name of something followed by a dot, then you can use
[tab completion](../learners/reference.md#tab-completion)
(e.g. type `numpy.` and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>)
to see a list of all functions and attributes that you can use. After selecting one, you
can also add a question mark (e.g. `numpy.cumprod?`), and IPython will return an
explanation of the method! This is the same as doing `help(numpy.cumprod)`.
Similarly, if you are using the "plain vanilla" Python interpreter, you can type `numpy.`
and press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key twice for a listing of what is available. You can then use the
`help()` function to see an explanation of the function you're interested in,
for example: `help(numpy.cumprod)`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When analyzing data, though,
we often want to look at variations in statistical values,
such as the maximum inflammation per patient
or the average inflammation per day.
One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want,
then ask it to do the calculation:

```python
patient_0 = data[0, :] # 0 on the first axis (rows), everything on the second (columns)
print('maximum inflammation for patient 0:', numpy.amax(patient_0))
```

```output
maximum inflammation for patient 0: 18.0
```

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

```python
print('maximum inflammation for patient 2:', numpy.amax(data[2, :]))
```

```output
maximum inflammation for patient 2: 19.0
```

What if we need the maximum inflammation for each patient over all days (as in the
next diagram on the left) or the average for each day (as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![](fig/python-operations-across-axes.png){alt="Per-patient maximum inflammation is computed row-wise across all columns usingnumpy.amax(data, axis=1). Per-day average inflammation is computed column-wise across all rows usingnumpy.mean(data, axis=0)."}

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
```

```output
[  0.           0.45         1.11666667   1.75         2.43333333   3.15
   3.8          3.88333333   5.23333333   5.51666667   5.95         5.9
   8.35         7.73333333   8.36666667   9.5          9.58333333
  10.63333333  11.56666667  12.35        13.25        11.96666667
  11.03333333  10.16666667  10.           8.66666667   9.15         7.25
   7.33333333   6.58333333   6.06666667   5.95         5.11666667   3.6
   3.3          3.56666667   2.48333333   1.5          1.13333333
   0.56666667]
```

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
```

```output
(40,)
```

The expression `(40,)` tells us we have an NÃ—1 vector,
so this is the average inflammation per day for all patients.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
```

```output
[ 5.45   5.425  6.1    5.9    5.55   6.225  5.975  6.65   6.625  6.525
  6.775  5.8    6.225  5.75   5.225  6.3    6.55   5.7    5.85   6.55
  5.775  5.825  6.175  6.1    5.8    6.425  6.05   6.025  6.175  6.55
  6.175  6.35   6.725  6.125  7.075  5.725  5.925  6.15   6.075  5.75
  5.975  5.725  6.3    5.9    6.75   5.925  7.225  6.15   5.95   6.275  5.7
  6.1    6.825  5.975  6.725  5.7    6.25   6.4    7.05   5.9  ]
```

which is the average inflammation per patient across all days.

## Slicing Strings

A section of an array is called a [slice](../learners/reference.md#slice).
We can take slices of character strings as well:

```python
element = 'oxygen'
print('first three characters:', element[0:3])
print('last three characters:', element[3:6])
```

```output
first three characters: oxy
last three characters: gen
```

What is the value of `element[:4]`?
What about `element[4:]`?
Or `element[:]`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```output
oxyg
en
oxygen
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

What is `element[-1]`?
What is `element[-2]`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```output
n
e
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Given those answers,
explain what `element[1:-1]` does.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Creates a substring from index 1 up to (not including) the final index,
effectively removing the first and last letters from 'oxygen'


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

How can we rewrite the slice for getting the last three characters of `element`,
so that it works even if we assign a different string to `element`?
Test your solution with the following strings: `carpentry`, `clone`, `hi`.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
element = 'oxygen'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
element = 'carpentry'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
element = 'clone'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
element = 'hi'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
```

```output
last three characters: gen
last three characters: try
last three characters: one
last three characters: hi
```

## Thin Slices

The expression `element[3:3]` produces an
[empty string](../learners/reference.md#empty-string),
i.e., a string that contains no characters.
If `data` holds our array of patient data,
what does `data[3:3, 4:4]` produce?
What about `data[3:3, :]`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```output
array([], shape=(0, 0), dtype=float64)
array([], shape=(0, 40), dtype=float64)

## Stacking Arrays

Arrays can be concatenated and stacked on top of one another,
using NumPy's `vstack` and `hstack` functions for vertical and horizontal stacking, respectively.

```python
import numpy

A = numpy.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7, 8, 9]])
print('A = ')
print(A)

B = numpy.hstack([A, A])
print('B = ')
print(B)

C = numpy.vstack([A, A])
print('C = ')
print(C)
```

```output
A =
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
B =
[[1 2 3 1 2 3]
 [4 5 6 4 5 6]
 [7 8 9 7 8 9]]
C =
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]
 [1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
```

Write some additional code that slices the first and last columns of `A`,
and stacks them into a 3x2 array.
Make sure to `print` the results to verify your solution.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

A 'gotcha' with array indexing is that singleton dimensions
are dropped by default. That means `A[:, 0]` is a one dimensional
array, which won't stack as desired. To preserve singleton dimensions,
the index itself can be a slice or array. For example, `A[:, :1]` returns
a two dimensional array with one singleton dimension (i.e. a column
vector).

```python
D = numpy.hstack((A[:, :1], A[:, -1:]))
print('D = ')
print(D)
```

```output
D =
[[1 3]
 [4 6]
 [7 9]]
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

An alternative way to achieve the same result is to use Numpy's
delete function to remove the second column of A. If you're not
sure what the parameters of numpy.delete mean, use the help files.

```python
D = numpy.delete(arr=A, obj=1, axis=1)
print('D = ')
print(D)
```

```output
D =
[[1 3]
 [4 6]
 [7 9]]
```

## Change In Inflammation

The patient data is *longitudinal* in the sense that each row represents a
series of observations relating to one individual.  This means that
the change in inflammation over time is a meaningful concept.
Let's find out how to calculate changes in the data contained in an array
with NumPy.

The `numpy.diff()` function takes an array and returns the differences
between two successive values. Let's use it to examine the changes
each day across the first week of patient 3 from our inflammation dataset.

```python
patient3_week1 = data[3, :7]
print(patient3_week1)
```

```output
 [0. 0. 2. 0. 4. 2. 2.]
```

Calling `numpy.diff(patient3_week1)` would do the following calculations

```python
[ 0 - 0, 2 - 0, 0 - 2, 4 - 0, 2 - 4, 2 - 2 ]
```

and return the 6 difference values in a new array.

```python
numpy.diff(patient3_week1)
```

```output
array([ 0.,  2., -2.,  4., -2.,  0.])
```

Note that the array of differences is shorter by one element (length 6).

When calling `numpy.diff` with a multi-dimensional array, an `axis` argument may
be passed to the function to specify which axis to process. When applying
`numpy.diff` to our 2D inflammation array `data`, which axis would we specify?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Since the row axis (0) is patients, it does not make sense to get the
difference between two arbitrary patients. The column axis (1) is in
days, so the difference is the change in inflammation -- a meaningful
concept.

```python
numpy.diff(data, axis=1)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

If the shape of an individual data file is `(60, 40)` (60 rows and 40
columns), what would the shape of the array be after you run the `diff()`
function and why?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The shape will be `(60, 39)` because there is one fewer difference between
columns than there are columns in the data.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

How would you find the largest change in inflammation for each patient? Does
it matter if the change in inflammation is an increase or a decrease?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

By using the `numpy.amax()` function after you apply the `numpy.diff()`
function, you will get the largest difference between days.

```python
numpy.amax(numpy.diff(data, axis=1), axis=1)
```

```python
array([  7.,  12.,  11.,  10.,  11.,  13.,  10.,   8.,  10.,  10.,   7.,
         7.,  13.,   7.,  10.,  10.,   8.,  10.,   9.,  10.,  13.,   7.,
        12.,   9.,  12.,  11.,  10.,  10.,   7.,  10.,  11.,  10.,   8.,
        11.,  12.,  10.,   9.,  10.,  13.,  10.,   7.,   7.,  10.,  13.,
        12.,   8.,   8.,  10.,  10.,   9.,   8.,  13.,  10.,   7.,  10.,
         8.,  12.,  10.,   7.,  12.])
```

If inflammation values *decrease* along an axis, then the difference from
one element to the next will be negative. If
you are interested in the **magnitude** of the change and not the
direction, the `numpy.absolute()` function will provide that.

Notice the difference if you get the largest *absolute* difference
between readings.

```python
numpy.amax(numpy.absolute(numpy.diff(data, axis=1)), axis=1)
```

```python
array([ 12.,  14.,  11.,  13.,  11.,  13.,  10.,  12.,  10.,  10.,  10.,
        12.,  13.,  10.,  11.,  10.,  12.,  13.,   9.,  10.,  13.,   9.,
        12.,   9.,  12.,  11.,  10.,  13.,   9.,  13.,  11.,  11.,   8.,
        11.,  12.,  13.,   9.,  10.,  13.,  11.,  11.,  13.,  11.,  13.,
        13.,  10.,   9.,  10.,  10.,   9.,   9.,  13.,  10.,   9.,  10.,
        11.,  13.,  10.,  10.,  12.])
```
